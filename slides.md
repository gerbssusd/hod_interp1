# The Shadow Archetype

- ## The Shadow is a very common archetype that reflects deeper elements of our psyche, where latent dispositions which are common to us all arise. 

- ## Our shadow may appear in dreams, hallucinations and musings, often as something or someone who is bad, fearsome or despicable in some way. 

- ## It also reflects something that was once split from us in early management of the objects in our lives.

# The Shadow Archetype

## We tend to see it in “others.” That is to say, we project our dark side onto others and thus interpret them as “enemies” or as “exotic.”

- Thus, the shadow is the personification of that part of human, psychic possibility that we deny in ourselves and project onto others. 

- The goal of personality integration is to integrate the rejected, inferior side of our life into our total experience and to take responsibility for it.

# The Shadow Archetype

- It is, by its name, dark, shadowy, unknown and potentially troubling. It embodies chaos and wildness of character. 

- The shadow thus tends not to obey rules, and in doing so may discover new lands or plunge things into chaos and battle. 

- It has a sense of the exotic and can be disturbingly fascinating. In myth, it appears as the wild man, spider-people, mysterious fighters and dark enemies.

# The Archetypal Quest

- ## HOD is a modern myth (= tradition of quest narrative)
    - In a quest, the story develops as a central character, the hero, meets and overcomes a series of obstacles on the way to accomplishing a task. 
    - archetypal quest stories – Virgil’s Aeneid & Dante's Inferno
- ## HOD contains mythological “quest”elements: 
  - fellow journeymen (the Pilgrims)
  - a fool (the Harlequin = the Russian)
  - a set of obstacles as they travel down river  (“descent to the underworld”)

# The Archetypal Quest
#  But is there a conventional hero?
<div style="text: red;"> It is unclear whether the hero is Marlow or Kurtz. 
Marlow is a flawed hero - for most of the book he lacks insight and is uncertain of the nature of his own quest, nor is it clear why he is obsessed by Kurtz. 
Kurtz himself remains an enigma. This quest yields an empty prize: the mystery, the task, remains incomplete, "unsolved." </div>

Marxist Interpretation
“Marxism” refers to the economics of class warfare.
Heart of Darkness is a depiction of, and an attack upon, colonialism in general, and, more specifically, the brutal form colonialism took in the Belgian Congo. 
the mistreatment of the Africans 
the greed of the so-called "pilgrims" 
the broken idealism of Kurtz
the French man-of-war lobbing shells into the jungle 
the grove of death which Marlow stumbles upon
the little note that Kurtz appends to his noble-minded essay on The Suppression of Savage Customs
the importance of ivory to the economics of the system.

Sociological/Cultural Interpretation
Heart of Darkness may also be read as a sociological investigation of those who conquer and those who are conquered, and the complicated interplay between them. 
Marlow's invocation of the Roman conquest of Britain 
cultural ambiguity of those Africans who have taken on some of the ways of their Europeans 
the ways in which the wilderness tends to strip away the civility of the Europeans and brutalize them 
Conrad is not impartial and scientifically detached from these things, and he even has a bit of fun with such impartiality in his depiction the doctor who tells Marlow that people who go out to Africa become "scientifically interesting."

Psychological Interpretation
Conrad goes out of his way to suggest that in some sense Marlow's journey is like a dream or a return to our primitive past -- an exploration of the dark recesses of the human mind. 
Apparent similarities to the psychological theories of Sigmund Freud in its suggestion that dreams are a clue to hidden areas of the mind
we are all primitive brutes and savages, capable of the most appalling wishes and the most horrifying impulses (the Id)
we can make sense of the urge Marlow feels to leave his boat and join the natives for a savage whoop and holler 
notice that Marlow keeps insisting that Kurtz is a voice -- a voice who seems to speak to him out of the heart of the immense darkness

![Slide Image](/slide_11_img_1.png)
Religious Interpretation
Heart of Darkness is also an examination of various aspects of religion and religious practices.
the way Conrad plays with the concept of pilgrims and pilgrimages 
the role of Christian missionary concepts in the justifications of the colonialists
the dark way in which Kurtz fulfills his own messianic ambitions by setting himself up as one of the local gods

---

![Slide Image](/public/slide_12_img_1.png)
Moral Interpretation
Heart of Darkness is preoccupied with general questions about the nature of good and evil, or civilization and savagery. 
Moral ambiguity is a central concept in the novel, and is expressed throughout the narrative in the tension between opposing forces.
Irony is also deeply embedded in the novel.
At one level, it shows the hypocrisy of the Europeans’ “moral” purpose of invading Africa, when their motive is really only commercial. 
At another level, it shows how these European emissaries, instead of 'suppressing savage customs,' actually become savages themselves.

Moral Interpretation
Civilization versus wilderness
Culture versus savagery
Fascination versus repulsion
Freedom versus restraint
Innocence versus experience
Justice versus injustice
Reality versus unreality
Strength versus weakness
Success versus failure
Work versus idleness

Ambiguity & Clarity
Moral ambiguity and irony are not the easiest forms of expression to cope with when you are a student and are asked to express yourself clearly and directly.
But it is precisely because the world often appears to be ambiguous and ironic that we must strive to speak and write clearly.
Otherwise, there is only darkness, only confusion.
